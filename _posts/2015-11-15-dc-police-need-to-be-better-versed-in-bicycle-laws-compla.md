description: 'A car door swings open and a passing cyclist hits it. A car comes abreast of a bike rider and makes a right turn. They collide. A car overtaking a cyclist clips the rider from behind. Who is at fault? In the District, the police are often confused, and when they are they tend to get it wrong.'
