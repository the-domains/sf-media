description: 'You probably think that if a negligent driver kills a member of your family, that person would face the prospect of jail time. But if you live in Maryland, you would likely be wrong. Currently, Maryland law has no mechanism for criminal punishment of a driver who kills another unless there is evidence of intoxication or gross negligence.'
