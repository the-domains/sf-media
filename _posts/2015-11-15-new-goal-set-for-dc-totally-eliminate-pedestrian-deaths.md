description: "The Bowser administration is adopting Vision Zero, a program embraced by six other U.S. cities to date designed to eliminate all traffic fatalities. A formal announcement is expected in the next couple weeks, an administration spokesman said, and the mayor declined to speculate on specific aspects of the program's implementation in brief remarks with WAMU 88.5 on Monday."
