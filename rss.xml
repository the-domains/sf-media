            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>D.C. bill would make it easier for cyclists, pedestrians to collect damages</h1><p>Advocates for cyclists and pedestrians rallied Thursday morning in support of a D.C. bill that would make it easier for cyclists to collect damages when they're injured in collisions with vehicles. Current law recognizes contributory negligence, meaning that if the cyclist or pedestrian is found to be 1 percent at fault in a crash, he or she cannot recover damages.</p><img src="https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/dr-gridlock/files/2014/07/M-Street-bike-lane.jpg"></article>]]></description>
