            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What is "contributory negligence," and why is it such a big danger for cyclists and pedestrians?</h1><p>Say you are riding along on your bicycle. Your tail light battery dies one evening, and then a texting driver crashes into you. Can you recover your medical costs from the driver? Photo by Moff on Flickr. Or, say you are on foot and need to cross a street where the nearest crosswalks are far away.</p><img src="http://greatergreater.com/images/201409/231618.jpg"></article>]]></description>

DC Councilmembers David Grosso, Tommy Wells, and Mary Cheh recently co-introduced a bill authored by Mr. Grosso that would exempt bicyclist-automobile crashes from the doctrine of contributory negligence.</p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*JLnTJsGyM882OFtimGCxDw.jpeg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>D.C. Advocates Seek Cultural Shift in View of Cyclists</h1><p>Can you legislate a culture shift, using the law to change the way drivers perceive cyclists? That was was one of the questions that a D.C. Council committee pondered yesterday as it heard the testimony of cyclists who had been hit or harassed by drivers and debated whether legislation or stricter enforcement would foster the acceptance of the two-wheeled on District roads.</p><img src="http://dcist.com/assets_c/2011/11/11.03.2011_bike-thumb-640xauto-671662.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bike Advocates Oppose Mandatory Helmet Laws</h1><p>This morning's Washington Post reports that organized bicycling enthusiasts in Maryland, though a very safety-oriented bunch, are mostly not supporting a bill in the state House of Delegates filed by Del. Maggie McIntosh (D-Baltimore) that would make helmet use mandatory for riders: "We feel that everyone should wear a helmet," said Carol Silldorff, executive director of the nonprofit group Bike Maryland.</p><img src="http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/default_images/blog_torch_large.gif"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What does it mean to ride a bicycle responsibly?</h1><p>Photo: Mike Gifford Is it a good idea to ride a bicycle responsibly? I doubt there are many out there who would say it isn't. But there is no consensus about what exactly constitutes responsible riding. The topic has generated intense debate since the bicycle was invented.</p><img src="http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/not-responsible-mike-gifford-flickr-500.jpg"></article>]]></description>

They don't.</p><img src="https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/WashingtonPost/Content/Blogs/daily-gripe/StandingArt/bike%20lane%203.JPG"></article>]]></description>
