            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What is "contributory negligence," and why is it such a big danger for cyclists and pedestrians?</h1><p>Say you are riding along on your bicycle. Your tail light battery dies one evening, and then a texting driver crashes into you. Can you recover your medical costs from the driver? Photo by Moff on Flickr. Or, say you are on foot and need to cross a street where the nearest crosswalks are far away.</p><img src="http://greatergreater.com/images/201409/231618.jpg"></article>]]></description>

They don't.</p><img src="https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/WashingtonPost/Content/Blogs/daily-gripe/StandingArt/bike%20lane%203.JPG"></article>]]></description>
