            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Kill on the road. Get off with a ticket.</h1><p>You probably think that if a negligent driver kills a member of your family, that person would face the prospect of jail time. But if you live in Maryland, you would likely be wrong. Currently, Maryland law has no mechanism for criminal punishment of a driver who kills another unless there is evidence of intoxication or gross negligence.</p><img src="https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2011/04/01/Editorial-Opinion/Images/2828718.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Your tail light battery dies one evening, and then a texting driver crashes into you. Can you recover your medical costs from the driver? Photo by Moff on Flickr. Or, say you are on foot and need to cross a street where the nearest crosswalks are far away.</p><img src="http://greatergreater.com/images/201409/231618.jpg"></article>]]></description>
